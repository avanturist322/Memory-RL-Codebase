### A simple and scalable agent for sequence-based Reinforcement Learning

AMAGO is a POMDP solver with an emphasis on long sequences, sparse rewards, and large networks. It is:
- **Broadly Applicable**. Environments are converted to a universal sequence format for memory-enabled policies. Classic benchmarks, goal-conditioning, long-term memory, meta-learning, and generalization are all special cases of its POMDP format. Supports discrete and continuous actions.
- **Scalable**. AMAGO is powered by an efficient learning update that looks more like supervised sequence modeling than RL. It is specifically designed for training large policies (like Transformers) on long sequences (500+ timesteps). Large replay buffers are stored on disk.
- **Sample Efficient**. AMAGO is off-policy and can continuously reuse (and hindsight relabel) large datasets of past trajectories.
- **Easy to Use**. Technical details can be easily customized but are designed to require little hyperparamter tuning.


## Background
AMAGO treats multi-task RL, meta-RL, RL generalization, and long-term memory as variations of the same POMDP problem that can be solved with sequence learning. This core framework goes by many different names including [implicit partial observability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.06277), [context-based meta-learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.08028), or [contextual MDPs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.09794).

AMAGO learns from off-policy or offline data, which improves sample efficiency and enables hindsight experience replay for goal-conditioned environments. We find a stable and high-performance way to train off-policy actor-critic agents on top of the representations from a shared sequence model, and all of the low-level details have been redesigned from scratch to be scalable enough to train long-context Transformers. Please refer to our [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09971) for a detailed explanation.

## Installation 

```bash
# download source
git clone git@github.com:UT-Austin-RPL/amago.git
cd amago
# make a fresh conda environment with python 3.10
conda create -n amago python==3.10
conda activate amago
# install core agent
pip install -e .
# AMAGO includes built-in support for a number of benchmark environments that can be installed with:
pip install -e .[envs]
```
The default Transformer policy (`nets.traj_encoders.TformerTrajEncoder`) has an option for [FlashAttention 2.0](https://github.com/Dao-AILab/flash-attention). FlashAttention leads to significant speedups on long sequences if your GPU is compatible. We try to install this for you with: `pip install -e .[flash]`, but please refer to the [official installation instructions](https://github.com/Dao-AILab/flash-attention) if you run into issues.

## Getting Started
Applying AMAGO to any new environment requires 5 basic choices. The `examples/` folder includes helpful starting points for common cases.

<p align="center">

</p>

1. **How do timesteps become vectors?** AMAGO standardizes its training process by creating a `TstepEncoder` to map timesteps to a fixed size representation. Timesteps (`hindsight.Timestep`) consist of observations, meta-RL data (rewards, dones, actions, reset signals), and optional goal descriptions. We include customizable defaults for the two most common cases of images and state arrays.

2. **How do sequences of timestep vectors become sequences of POMDP state vectors?** The `TrajEncoder` is a seq2seq model that enables long-term memory and in-context learning by processing `TstepEncoder` outputs. AMAGO is designed for large-scale sequence models like Transformers.

3. **What defines the end of a rollout?** Are we optimizing a single trial that ends when the environment terminates, or is this a meta-RL setting where we should auto reset to the same environment until a fixed time limit is reached? In any case we need to define an upper bound on the rollout length (`horizon`).
   
4. **What is the memory limit of our policy?** True meta-RL and long-term memory tasks would require a `max_seq_len` >= the horizon. If the horizon is unrealisticlly long or unncessary for the complexity of the problem, we can approximate by shortening the context.
   
5. **How often do we save sequences as training samples, even if the rollout hasn't ended?** Parallel actors automatically save `.traj` files for rollouts up to this length, which should >= `max_seq_len`. As a general rule, `traj_save_len > horizon` unless rollouts are >> `max_seq_len` and we need to speedup reads from disk during training.

## A Tour of AMAGO in 9 Examples

To follow most of the examples you'll need to install the benchmark environments with `pip install amago[envs]`.
AMAGO logs to [`wandb`](https://docs.wandb.ai). You can configure the project and account with environment variables:

```bash
export AMAGO_WANDB_PROJECT="wandb project name"
export AMAGO_WANDB_ENTITY="wandb username"
```

### 1. **Regular MDPs (Classic Gym)**
   
Many popular benchmarks are MDPs and can be treated as a simple special case of the full agent. Toggling *off* memory, goal-conditioning/relabeling, and multi-episodic resets reduces AMAGO to a regular off-policy actor-critic like you've seen before. This is mainly meant to be an ablation to test the impact of memory. However, AMAGO is a stable variant of [REDQ](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.05982)/[CRR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.15134) with improvements like "multi-gamma" training that are especially useful in sparse reward environments. See `examples/01_basic_gym.py` for an example.

<details>
<summary> <b>Example Training Commands</b> </summary>
<br>

Train a memory-free policy on built-in gymnasium benchmarks:

```bash
python 01_basic_gym.py --env LunarLander-v2 --horizon 500 --traj_encoder ff --max_seq_len 32 --memory_layers 2 --no_async --gpu <int> --run_name <str> --buffer_dir <path>
```
This examples uses a `TrajEncoder` that is just a feedforward network. Training still depends on sequences of `--max_seq_len` timesteps, which is effectively increasing the training batch size.

</details>
 
### 2. **POMDPs and Long-Term Memory (POPGym)**
   
Using a memory-equipped `TrajEncoder`, but toggling *off* goals and multi-episodic resets creates an effective POMDP solver. AMAGO is efficient enough to use *entire* trajectories as context, and the `TformerTrajEncoder` is a strong default Transformer tuned specifically for stability in RL. See `examples/02_popgym_suite.py` where the same hyperparameters can lead to state-of-the-art performance across the [POPGym](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01859) suite.

<details>
<summary> <b>Example Training Commands</b> </summary>
<br>

```bash
python 02_popgym_suite.py --env AutoencodeMedium --parallel_actors 24 --trials 3 --epochs 650 --dset_max_size 80_000 --memory_layers 3 --memory_size 256 --gpu <int> --run_name <str> --buffer_dir <path>
```
</details>
 
### 3. **Fixed-Horizon Meta-RL (Dark-Key-To-Door)**

Meta-RL problems are just POMDPs that automatically reset the task up until a fixed time limit. `TrajEncoder` sequence models let us remember and improve upon past attempts. `examples/03_dark_key_to_door.py` walks through a toy example from the [Algorithm Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.14215) paper.

<details>
<summary> <b>Example Training Commands</b> </summary>
<br>

```bash
python 03_dark_key_to_door.py --memory_layers 3 --memory_size 256 --epochs 650 --room_size 9 --episode_length 50 --meta_horizon 500 --gpu <int> --run_name <str> --buffer_dir <path>
```
</details>
 
### 4. **Zero-Shot Adaptation to Goal-Conditioned Environments (Mazerunner)**

`examples/04_mazerunner.py` uses the hindsight instruction relabeling technique from the AMAGO paper on our MazeRunner navigation domain. The ability to relabel rewards in hindsight is a key advantage of off-policy adaptive agents.

### 5. and 6. **K-Shot Meta-RL (Metaworld and Alchemy)**

`examples/05_kshot_metaworld.py` uses [Metaworld](https://meta-world.github.io) to show how we can setup a meta-RL problem that ends after a certain number of episodes, rather than a fixed horizon `H`. We can let the environment automatically reset itself `k - 1` times while AMAGO pretends it's a zero-shot problem (as long as the resets are added to the observation space). `examples/06_alchemy.py` shows another example on the symbolic version of [DeepMind Alchemy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.02926).

<details>
<summary> <b>Example Training Commands</b> </summary>
<br>

Train a transformer policy with a context length of 128 timesteps on 2-shot (`--k 2`) Reach-v2:
```bash
python 05_kshot_metaworld.py --k 2 --benchmark reach-v2 --max_seq_len 128 --epochs 700 --timesteps_per_epoch 1500 --grads_per_epoch 700 --gpu <int> --run_name <str> --buffer_dir <path>
```
</details>
 
### 7. **Goal-Conditioned Open-Worlds (Crafter)**

AMAGO can adapt to procedurally generated environments while completing multi-step instructions. `examples/07_crafter_with_instructions.py` shows how we turn [Crafter](https://danijar.com/project/crafter/) into an instruction-conditioned environment, and then use AMAGO's hindsight relabeling to explore sparse rewards.

<details>
<summary> <b>Example Training Commands</b> </summary>
<br>

Memory-conservative settings with pixel-based observations:

```bash
python 07_crafter_with_instructions.py --max_seq_len 512 --obs_kind crop --start_learning_at_epoch 5 --memory_size 256 --memory_layers 3 --relabel some --epochs 5000 --timesteps_per_epoch 2000 --gpu <int> --run_name <str> --buffer_dir <path>
```

The command above is a close replication of the pixel-based version (Appendix C5 Table 2). You can watch gameplay of a pretrained checkpoint on user-specified tasks with the `examples/crafter_pixels_demo.ipynb` notebook.

After training you can run the same command with an added `--eval_mode` argument to evaluate the full random task distribution in addition to a hardcoded list of specified tasks (including individual goals). The "best" checkpoint is loaded by default (highest average return on train distribution) but you can specify an epoch checkpoint number with `--ckpt`.

### 8. **Multi-Task Learning from Pixels (Retro Games)**

Meta-learning and multi-task learning without task labels are essentially the same problem. We can use short sequences to train an agent on multiple levels of the same video game (or multiple games). `examples/08_multitask_mario.py` provides an example on levels from Super Mario using [stable-retro](https://stable-retro.farama.org). Note that this script requires some extra installation beyond `pip install amago[envs]`. 

### 9. **Super Long-Term Memory (Passive T-Maze)**

AMAGO provides a stable way to train long-sequence Transformers with RL, which can turn traditionally hard memory-based environments into simple problems. `examples/09_tmaze.py` adds a few exploration changes to the TMaze environment from [Ni et al., 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03864), which lets us recall information for thousands of timesteps.

<details>
<summary> <b>Example Training Commands</b> </summary>
<br>

Example on a horizon of 400 timesteps:
```bash
python 09_tmaze.py --no_async --memory_size 128 --memory_layers 2 --parallel_actors 36 --horizon 400 --timesteps_per_epoch 800  --grads_per_epoch 600 --dset_max_size 5000 --gpu <int> --run_name <str> --buffer_dir <path>
```
This command with `--horizon 10000 --timesteps_per_epoch 10000` will also train the extreme 10k sequence length mentioned in the paper, although this takes several days to converge due to the inference cost of generating each trajectory.
</details>
 
## Advanced Configuration

AMAGO is built around [gin-config](https://github.com/google/gin-config), which makes it easy to customize experiments. `gin` makes hyperparameters a default value for an object's `kwargs`, and lets you set their value without editing the source code. You can read more about gin [here](https://github.com/google/gin-config/blob/master/docs/index.md). The `examples/` avoid any `.gin` config files and let you switch between the most important settings without worrying about any of this.
